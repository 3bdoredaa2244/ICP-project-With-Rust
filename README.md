ICP Hello World with Rust :

This repository contains a simple "Hello World" project developed for the Internet Computer (ICP) using the Rust programming language. The project demonstrates the basic structure and usage of the Internet Computer platform with Rust backend development, focusing on canisters and the integration between frontend and backend.

Project Overview
This project is designed to showcase how to build and deploy a basic ICP application using the Rust programming language. It contains both backend and frontend components that work together to serve as a foundation for more advanced ICP applications.

Technologies Used
Rust: The backend logic is written in Rust using the DFINITY SDK for developing canisters.

Internet Computer (ICP): The decentralized platform where the canisters are deployed.

Motoko: A language specific to ICP for writing canisters, though the backend is implemented in Rust in this example.

Frontend: The frontend is built using standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
Backend Canister: Implements the logic for a simple "Hello World" functionality.

Frontend: A basic user interface that interacts with the backend canister to display the "Hello World" message.

Rust Integration: Demonstrates how to develop ICP canisters using Rust.

Installation
Prerequisites
Rust (including cargo and rustup) installed.

DFINITY SDK installed for building and deploying canisters.

A GitHub account to clone the repository and push updates.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/3bdoredaa2244/ICP-project-With-Rust.git
cd ICP-project-With-Rust
Install Rust dependencies:


cargo build
Configure the DFINITY SDK:

Ensure that you have dfx installed. If not, you can install it by following the instructions from the DFINITY website.

Deploy the canisters:


dfx deploy
This will deploy the backend canister to the Internet Computer network.

Start the frontend server:

Navigate to the frontend folder and run:


npm install
npm start
This will start a local server where you can view the frontend interacting with the deployed backend canister.

Usage
Once the deployment is complete, you can access the frontend at http://localhost:3000 (or wherever the server is hosted). The page will display a "Hello World" message fetched from the backend canister.
